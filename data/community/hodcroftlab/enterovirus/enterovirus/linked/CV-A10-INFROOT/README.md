## Scope of this dataset

Based on the full genome sequence, this dataset uses the Kowalik reference sequence ([AY421767.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY421767.1)). It provides a framework for quality control, clade assignment, and mutation calling across global CV-A10 diversity.

***Note:** The Kowalik reference is substantially diverged from currently circulating strains. This is common for many enterovirus datasets, in contrast to some other virus datasets (e.g., seasonal influenza) where the reference is updated more frequently to match recent sequences. For this reason, two alternative references are supplied (Static Inferred Root, Tree Root) for mutation calling.*
